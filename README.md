# ContactManager
 
The Contact Manager app had included all the functionalities as well as the Bonus points. 

Just to clarify, everything is coded in App.js just for quick-coding and easy-to-review purpose. 
And I made the styling as simple as possible for the same reason.
I am able to improve the components/structures and styles if I have more time to work on it. 
After all it’s just a couple-hour quick project. 
I would like to talk about how and where to make improvements regarding the features of Contact Manager app.

P.S. After npm install all the dependencies, we better do “npx react-native run-android” to run it on Android devices to test out the functionalities. 
Since we are not involved in one Dev Team with Apple accounts, it would take time to run the app on iOS devices due to it.
